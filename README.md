# Attention-Patterns-in-Extended-Reality
This is the official code repo for our ISMAR '24 paper, *"Looking" into Attention Patterns in Extended Reality: An Eye Tracking-Based Study* by Zhehan Qu, Ryleigh Byrne and [Maria Gorlatova](https://maria.gorlatova.com/current-research/). The Arxiv version of the paper can be found [here](temp). The overview of our study is shown in Figure 1.

Please refer to the individual READMEs at [first order analysis](gaze_data_analysis/README.md), [machine learning](mvts_transformer/README_Sudoku.md) and [sudoku_hint_generator](sudoku_hint_generator/README.md) for code descriptions. Note that for each sub-component there's a separate `requirements.txt`. Unfortunately, due to our IRB protocol we cannot release the eye gaze data we collected. Sample data are provided in [dataset](dataset) to show the format.
